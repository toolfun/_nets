VISION
The concentration of power in traditional internet, financial, and governance systems is 
straying from the interests of their constituents, resulting in a lack of transparency and 
accountability, as well as manipulation, dominance abuse, conflicts of interest, and single 
points of failure.


Bitcoin ushered in a new era with the deployment of blockchain technology —a shared 
database collectively managed by its users in an open peer-to-peer network. This 
innovation paved the way for new horizons in global value transfers, applying rules set in 
code without intermediaries. This development was quickly followed by the advent of 
general-purpose smart contracts in Ethereum.


In its infancy, the blockchain community propelled decentralized currencies to the trilliondollar mark, facilitated the construction of billion-dollar permissionless protocols on top of 
others, and fueled unprecedented collaborative innovations and impactful DAO decisions.  

However, it also experienced a staggering array of setbacks of hacks, censorship, 
manipulation, and rug pulls, all derived from instances of centralization occurring in 
various stages of the blockchain stack.
At the heart of Massa's vision is an unwavering belief in the 
transformative potential of decentralization.
Vision 3
Massa aims to be the first truly decentralized blockchain aligned with the interest of its users, 
demonstrating a fair and balanced distribution of control with no compromises on 
performance and security, and nurturing a developer-friendly ecosystem with cutting-edge 
smart contracts and accessible web3 tools. This is a result of combining a balanced coin 
distribution and a parallel block technology able to sustain 10,000 transactions per second 
with over 10,000 consensus nodes. Massa distributes power among its user community while 
defending against its concentration in a few dominating entities, as evidenced by its 
Nakamoto coefficient standing above 1,000.


To bolster decentralization, Massa has introduced two innovations. The first is Massa's 
Autonomous Smart Contracts, capable of self-activation based on predetermined conditions. 
This eliminates the need for centralized bot networks continuously monitoring the 
blockchain to trigger contract activity. The second innovation is on-chain web, allowing 
DApp front-ends to be hosted on *.massa websites. This allows DApps to operate with 
complete immutability and transparency, all the way to users accessing them via Massa 
Station, thereby mitigating prevalent front-end hacks in the so-called web3. Collectively, 
these advancements deliver a safer and more authentic web3 experience for developers and 
users, laying the groundwork for a genuinely decentralized web.
Accessibility is a vital condition for facilitating direct peer-to-peer interactions with minimal 
intermediaries. Massa strives to make staking, smart contracts building and DApp usage 
accessible. With minimal hardware and token requirements, anyone can operate a node and 
participate in securing the network by locking native tokens, as evidenced by the 7,000+ 
nodes in Massa testnet. With Massa, builders can write smart contracts in TypeScript, a 
language familiar to all web2 developers, making it well-suited for adoption.


Massa's mission is to create a more fair, efficient, accessible and safe blockchain ecosystem 
where users have greater control over their assets and experiences. By staying true to its 
core principles of decentralization and continuously innovating in smart contracts and their 
usage, Massa is poised to become a driving force propelling blockchain towards mass 
adoption.


Massa is the new host for Web3, empowering builders to shape the 
future of decentralized applications and users to participate in truly 
decentralized experiences.
Vision 4
The Centralization Crisis
 in Web 3
Blockchain technology, not controlled by intermediaries or a single entity, facilitates peerto-peer interactions that offer a level of security, censorship resistance, and trust 
unachievable with centralized systems. This is why decentralization is the very essence of 
blockchains.


However, a centralization crisis that compromises its foundational principles has disrupted 
the blockchain landscape. The past few years have shown how power concentration can 
infiltrate various aspects of Web3:
U Centralization of mining hardware production can create monopolies, raise entry 
barriers, and heighten the risk of 51% attacks8
U Disproportionate coin ownership among a small group can trigger market 
manipulation and skewed governance outcomes8
U Centralized data services can create single points of failure, disrupting network 
access for many users and applications8
U Centralization of access points to dApps can result in censorship and hacks, hindering 
users' access to decentralized services.
5
The Nakamoto coefficient, which quantifies the minimum number of entities needed to 
compromise an essential subsystem, provides a straightforward measure of decentralization. 
A higher Nakamoto coefficient signifies a more decentralized network. When considering 
block production, Bitcoin has a low Nakamoto coefficient of 4, Ethereum has now a 
coefficient of only 3. All other networks have a remarkably low coefficient ranging between 1 
and 10. Some have already experienced outages or hard forks due to centralization. Block 
production is only one of the potential influence points; others include coin distribution, 
voting power, codebase updates, and so on. The negative outcomes resulting from 
centralization are not merely theoretical, but have surfaced in the guise of manipulation, 
censorship, failures, and hacks, jeopardizing the fundamental notion of decentralization and 
casting doubt on the ecosystem’s future.


Alarming examples of manipulation within the blockchain ecosystem have revealed the 
potential for power and decision-making to be concentrated in the hands of a few wellfunded entities. This is evidenced when conflicting interests arise, for instance in
 The failure of the centralized cryptocurrency exchange FTX can largely be 
ascribed to the considerable power held by its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried. The

Overall, the centralization of staking power can lead to 51% attacks, where a group of 
colluding entities gain control of the majority of the network's block production, enabling 
them to double-spend or reverse previously confirmed transactions.


Censorship in the Web3 ecosystem has also emerged as a pressing concern, highlighting 
the dangers of power concentration. OpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace, faced 
backlash when it was revealed that it had secretly delisted certain NFTs 
raising questions about the platform's commitment to 
decentralization and transparency, and highlighting the potential for censorship in 
centralized services. Uniswap, a popular decentralized exchange, faced criticism when it 
 from its interface, effectively cutting off access to these tokens for 
many users, sparking a debate about centralized decision-making and the potential for 
censorship. And GitHub, a centralized code repository platform, has occasionally removed 
or restricted access to repositories containing code for decentralized applications or 
protocols, in response to requests or pressure.

Numerous Web3 failures can be traced back to centralization, as centralized control and 
infrastructure introduce risks and vulnerabilities that can cause network outages or other 
disruptions. In February 2023, the Fantom network experienced a significant incident that 
led to a indicating the risks associated with centralized 
control of block production. In November 2020, Ethereum's Infura service suffered a 
that disrupted numerous DApps and services, exposing the ecosystem's heavy 
reliance on a single, centralized infrastructure provider. In August 2021, Polygon experienced 
a network outage due to issues with its centralized infrastructure, also disrupting its 
ecosystem of DApps and services. In October 2021, Amazon Web Services (AWS) suffered a 
major outage that impacted several regions, causing disruptions to applications built on top 
of the Web3 ecosystem. These failures underscore the crucial need for prioritizing 
decentralization at all levels of the Web3 stack, from infrastructure and software design to 
governance and decision-making.


Hacks also have become increasingly prevalent in the centralized aspects of Web3, resulting 
in significant losses for users. In December 2022, BadgerDAO, a DeFi platform focused on 
Bitcoin yield farming, fell victim to a sophisticated hack to the front-end of the platform, 
enabling hackers to manipulate user transactions and steal approximately in 
digital assets.

The Centralization Crisis in Web 3
Blockchain bridges, which enable the transfer of assets between different networks, have 
become popular targets for hackers, resulting in billions of dollars of losses on Ronin, 
Harmony, and others. DeFi platforms have also faced numerous hacks due to 
centralization vulnerabilities, such as the August 2021 Poly Network hack ($600m) and 
the February 2022 Cream Finance hack ($130m). And centralized cryptocurrency 
exchanges, which facilitate the trading of digital assets, have also been frequent targets 
of hacking incidents, such as at Mt. Gox, once the largest Bitcoin exchange ($400m in 
2014) and Coincheck, a Japanese cryptocurrency exchange ($530m in 2018). All of these 
incidents highlight the risks associated with centralization and the problems of single 
points of failure.


Massa was created to confront the Web3 centralization crisis, ensuring a robust and 
secure ecosystem through meticulous system design, coupled with well-considered 
incentives and safeguards against centralizing forces. Our purpose is to uphold the core 
principles of decentralization and establish a decentralized internet that empowers 
individuals, lower power concentration in intermediaries, and fosters innovation.
The Centralization Crisis in Web 3

True Decentralization
 with Massa
To mitigate the centralization crisis, the Web3 community must genuinely adopt 
decentralization: distributing control fairly among users and eliminating hidden 
centralized bottlenecks. The community must ensure stakeholder alignment with users, 
granting everyone a substantial role in shaping the platform's future. 


Massa Labs, the initiating operational company behind Massa, is committed to fostering 
decentralization throughout its tenure, until it transitions to a mere participant within the 
community.  

Decentralization must extend across its three core dimensions: technical, economic, and
 
legal. In terms of technical decentralization, our focus lies in securing our protocol without
 
the reliance on centralized intermediaries. Moving to economic decentralization, our aim
 is 
to establish self-contained economies within our decentralized system. Moreover, we 
foster legal decentralization by carefully designing legal entities that align
 with our 
protocol's vision, ensuring compliance with legal frameworks. 



For the time being, ten key measures have been determined to safeguard 
decentralization, most of which have already been implemented.
8
RN Conducting a fair, transparent and balanced coin distribution
Massa aims for widespread ownership and participation within its ecosystem, guaranteeing 
that no single entity or small group can disproportionately influence the network. This begins 
with the wide distribution of Massa coins, the essential unit used for weighting validator 
nodes in Proof-of-Stake and votes in the on-chain governance system.


Analysis of coin distribution in Proof-of-Stake blockchains reveals three issues: a significant 
bias towards founders and other insiders/VCs from inception, major portions of these coins 
sold to other VCs without transparency on the terms, and no tendency towards further 
decentralization. That's why we've implemented several measures concerning the initial coin 
distribution to avoid such a situation:
Detailed explanations of these mechanisms are provided in the tokenomics section.
 Massa Labs will own a very small proportion of the token supply
 Each buyer in private sales is limited to a relatively small quantity
 Rather than holding a large token pool within the team and selling it at our discretion, we 
have established a decentralization program to foster broader participation with full 
transparency.
True Decentralization with Massa

 Using Proof-of-Stake instead of Proof-of-Work
As a block producer selection mechanism, Proof-of-Work drives concentration of block 
production in a limited number of actors in the long term. The larger a miner, the cheaper 
their electricity and mining equipment, thus yielding higher profitability per unit of 
investment. Also, due to professional actors, personal mining became minimally rewarding
—maybe one significant reward every ten years—prompting people to join pools to share 
the rewards. These factors have resulted in a scenario where less than four large pools or 
professional miners now generate the majority of Bitcoin blocks, effectively controlling 
the blockchain.


In contrast, Proof-of-Stake rewards participation linearly and regularly: each coin staked 
yields the same reward, with rewards allocated daily to amateur stakers. Furthermore, 
 These reasons drove 
Massa's choice of Proof-of-Stake.
Proof-of-Stake consumes a way less energy than Proof-of-Work.
N Solving the blockchain trilemma
The blockchain trilemma emphasizes the competing demands of scalability, 
decentralization, and security in any blockchain. Massa employs a consensus mechanism 
similar to Bitcoin's – the Nakamoto consensus – to determine the final blocks.  However, 
rather than being sequential, blocks can now be generated simultaneously, in parallel, to 
scale the number of operations per second. 
Demonstrably, the technology can support thousands of operations per second in a 
decentralized network where thousands of nodes actively contribute to the consensus.  

This capability is not just theoretical or simulated, it has also been confirmed on the testnet, 
where over 7,000+ community nodes validated over 4,000 operations per second. This 
accomplished scalability comes with no compromise on decentralization or security.
¯ Maintaining low hardware requirements for node operation
While superior hardware can enhance network scaling, it would make node operation less 
affordable for many. Consequently, we have established the minimum hardware requirement 
at the level of a contemporary personal computer.
True Decentralization with Massa
 Avoiding the implementation of delegations
Examining the block production power in delegated Proof-of-Stake blockchains reveals 
the rise of new intermediaries between users and control - the delegators. Delegators 
take delegations from those who lack sufficient coins to stake, thereby staking on their 
behalf.


Usually, this delegation mechanism is coupled with a high minimum staking requirement 
to limit the number of consensus participants. This is because the technology used (BFT 
variations) does not allow 10,000+ consensus nodes and sacrifices decentralization for 
scaling – thus does not solve the blockchain trilemma.


Massa can support this number of nodes, so we refrain from implementing delegation, and 
encourage operating active nodes to validate and control the blockchain .
T Prohibiting custodial staking
A handful of centralized exchange platforms and staking providers collectively control 20 
to 50% of most blockchains, holding sway from block production to voting power by 
staking the pooled coins of their millions of users.


To curb this behavior and safeguard decentralization, we created a community charter 
that applies to Massa community members, particularly node runners.


This charter prohibits the practice of staking coins for others beyond a certain threshold. 
More information is provided in the community charter section.

 Ensuring the accessibility of Smart Contracts for all developers
Existing blockchain smart contract languages, from EVM's Solidity to others like Cairo, Rust, 
or Move, boast a limited developer base, complicating the transition from Web2 to Web3 for 
most developers. Massa utilizes a WebAssembly virtual machine and constructs smart 
contracts in AssemblyScript, a language akin to TypeScript and specifically designed for 
WebAssembly. TypeScript, one of the fastest-growing programming languages, has gained 
prominence due to its strong ties with JavaScript. With the vast majority of Web2 developers 
already well-versed in TypeScript, Massa is poised to easily draw and integrate new 
developers, thereby nurturing a dynamic and innovative Web3 community.
Web2 servers typically depend on background processes. Current blockchains lack the 
capability to autonomously execute operations; they can only run code when prompted 
within blocks. This limitation has compelled developers to devise centralized solutions, such 
as servers that monitor the blockchain and trigger operations like position liquidation. These 
servers not only incur costs but can also experience failures, shutdowns, crashes, or even 
manipulation of the supposedly immutable DApp.


Massa’s smart contracts have the unique ability to autonomously activate to handle 
operations, thus eliminating the need for centralized bots or keepers.
ü Eliminating the requirement for centralized keepers
True Decentralization with Massa
 Building the on-chain web
DApps exhibit decentralization only in their backend smart contracts. For a more userfriendly experience requiring a frontend, they invariably resort to Web2 centralized 
servers, like or . These frontend servers are perpetually vulnerable 
to hacking and censorship.
 
Massa introduces a method for on-chain storage of frontends on *.massa websites, 
offering the same level of transparency and immutability to the frontend that smart 
contracts enjoy. This allows users to interact with the DApp without any error-prone 
intermediaries. Users can initiate their authentic Web3 journey by accessing these 
decentralized websites through Massa Station.


Alongside TypeScript and autonomous smart contracts, these features furnish developers 
with a seamless and intuitive development experience. They can use the blockchain as 
more than just a shared database, rather as a fully-equipped Web3 server.

SU Establishing an on-chain governance system for collective decision-making on 
network parameters and updates
The Massa blockchain operates independently of any centralized legal entity. The initial 
entities are solely established to function within a decentralized ecosystem. These 
entities will partake in on-chain decision-making processes impacting the network, much 
like any other participant in the ecosystem.
The purview of core governance decisions encompasses the blockchain parameters and 
algorithms, the ledger, and the community charter. Core governance will incorporate onchain proposals and voting, based on staked coins. In Massa, voting via staked coins offers a 
more accurate representation of users and holders compared to other networks, owing to 
the equitable initial coin distribution and measures taken to curb custodial staking and 
delegations. The implementation of the on-chain proposal and voting system is slated for 
2024.
True Decentralization with Massa
Massa's vision for true decentralization stands as a beacon of hope in the Web3 
landscape, where many other protocols have struggled to achieve genuine 
decentralization. Massa, through its design, emerges as a truly decentralized 
ecosystem, directly addressing the centralization issues that afflict other networks. 


This steadfast dedication to decentralization bestows valuable benefits to the web3 
ecosystem: amplified participation harmonized with common interests, and bolstered 
security characterized by resistance to attacks, manipulation, and censorship. 


With Massa, Web3 can adhere to its foundational promise and empower individuals to 
play a substantial role in the digital landscape, thus laying the groundwork for a future 
that is equitable and ripe with innovation.
Technology
The exponential rise and acceptance of blockchain technology have brought about 
considerable challenges, encompassing aspects like energy consumption, scalability, and 
accessibility. There is a pressing need for innovative approaches that can overcome these 
limitations and unlock the full potential of blockchain technology while keeping the core 
principle of decentralization. Massa aims to address these challenges through the power 
of its parallel block technology, the ease of staking and writing smart contracts, and 
keeping an innovative mindset.
12
The Blockchain Trilemma
A blockchain is a shared server controlled by its community of users, with no central 
authority, bank or company deciding which program should run or which information 
should be added to the database. If a greater number of independent users participate in 
decisions (decentralization), then it takes more time to reach decisions (scalability), while 
maintaining the same level of certainty that decisions will not be tampered with 
(security). 


This elemental association is recognized as the blockchain trilemma, formally asserting 
the difficulty of enhancing one of these triad properties without adversely affecting the 
others. Solving the trilemma usually means improving the number of transactions per 
second without sacrificing decentralization nor security.
All blockchains that accomplish a scale of thousands of transactions per second actually 
compromise decentralization in the process, curtailing the number of independent users 
genuinely participating in consensus formation. Massa's technology addresses the 
blockchain trilemma utilizing a parallel block architecture, facilitating thousands of 
transactions per second with a Nakamoto coefficient exceeding 1,000.
Technology
The Blockchain Trilemma
Parallel Block Architecture
In Bitcoin, each block refers back to a previous one, forming a tree of blocks, and the 
Nakamoto consensus algorithm determines the optimal chain of blocks in that tree—
known as the blockchain. This chain structure slows block production because each node 
must receive the immediately preceding block to have a reasonable chance of creating a 
block that will be included in the blockchain.


Massa’s parallel block architecture allows nodes, when selected by Proof-of-Stake, to 
create blocks in parallel and still to make them all compatible with each other. Blocks are 
incorporated into a multithreaded graph, with each block referencing one block per 
thread, thus constructing a multithreaded Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Within Massa, a 
chain is a subset of the graph, termed a clique, and the consensus algorithm determines 
the most suitable clique to proceed from. Massa employs an adapted version of the 
Nakamoto consensus algorithm that aligns with the multithreaded graph. It selects the 
clique that demonstrates the most work—or fitness as it's referred to here.
Technology
14
One implication of enabling parallel blocks is the possibility of the same transaction 
appearing or being executed multiple times concurrently, which could result in space 
waste or double-spending. To circumvent this issue, Massa implements transaction 
sharding. Each transaction is allocated to a specific thread and can only be included in 
blocks within this thread, thereby eliminating the risk of duplicate inclusion in a clique. 

Contrary to their claims of high scalability, most blockchains employ a consensus 
algorithm that can't support a large number of significantly contributing nodes. Typically, 
these are variants of Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) algorithms that require a majority 
stake concentration in fewer than 100 nodes.


The demonstrates that Massa significantly outperforms traditional 
blockchain systems reliant on sequential block creation, with a transaction throughput of 
approximately 10,000 tx/s. This high performance is achieved while preserving 
decentralization due to the Nakamoto consensus, allowing meaningful participation of 
thousands of nodes in the network.
technical paper
Testnet Program
The objective of the Massa testnet program is to evaluate and enhance the security, 
scalability, and overall usability of the blockchain architecture under real conditions during 
its development phase. We released the first version of the testnet very early, in July 2021,

when basic consensus, peering and transaction processing were ready. 


Engaging a large group of participants in the testnet enables the network to approximate 
future mainnet conditions, particularly with respect to hardware diversity and 
heterogeneous connectivity. The Massa testnet drew 350 participants in its inaugural month 
of July 2021, and this number has progressively grown to over 7,000 stable nodes in recent 
months. The widespread adoption of Massa and its straightforward staking process 
surprisingly helped in building this extensive network of node operators. Presently, the Massa 
testnet holds the distinction of being the most decentralized network in blockchain history. It 
continually offers insights into the functioning of decentralized networks. The main features 
and improvements released since the first testnet are shown in the next figure. 
Technology
15
A heartfelt note of thanks to all node runners for their unwavering support in the rigorous 
testing of the Massa blockchain. Your perseverance in managing the bugs, system 
reboots, and load tests – integral aspects of any testnet environment – is sincerely 
appreciated. Thanks to your continued dedication and the vibrant community you've 
helped to cultivate, we're advancing steadily towards the highly anticipated launch of our 
mainnet.  
The testnet enabled our team to evaluate the scalability of the Massa blockchain under 
real-world conditions, rather than in simulations or labnets, amidst thousands of nodes 
operating with limited CPU, bandwidth, and memory. We gauged the network's 
performance by populating the transaction pool with valid transactions. The network 
consistently processed 500 transactions per second in January 2022, and following 
numerous optimizations, it gradually scaled up to 4,000 transactions per second by 
mid-2023.


Practical application of the testnet demonstrated that Massa's parallel block architecture 
can handle thousands of transactions per second in a truly decentralized network, with 
thousands of nodes significantly contributing to the consensus.

Staking is easy
For a blockchain network to truly embody the principles of decentralization, network 
participation should be straightforward, thus distributing power and control across a broad 
network of participants.


Massa employs an energy-efficient Proof-of-Stake algorithm to select block producers. 
Block producers are randomly selected to generate new blocks, contingent on the number 
of coins they possess and are prepared to stake. Staking rewards are frequent and linear: 
each staked coin gives the same reward, and rewards are distributed every day to any 
amateur node.


To facilitate validation and minimize entry barriers, the bare minimum hardware required 
for staking in Massa equates to that of a contemporary laptop – 8 cores, 16GB RAM, and 
1TB of disk space. These requirements may increase over the years to follow improvements 
in personal equipment. Furthermore, the minimum quantity of coins – a roll – needed to 
stake is set at 100 Massa coins, allowing in theory up to 10 million validators.

Massa Virtual Machine: an innovative mindset
To facilitate greater accessibility and powerful innovations, Massa abandoned the EVM as its 
virtual machine and crafted a custom WebAssembly (WASM) virtual machine for executing 
smart contracts. This approach provides benefits such as enabling developers to create and 
deploy smart contracts using familiar programming languages like TypeScript, and swiftly 
integrating new innovations, which would be unfeasible while adhering to EVM compatibility.
Smart Contracts in Typescript
The first supported language for writing smart contracts on Massa is AssemblyScript, a 
subset of TypeScript optimized for WebAssembly. TypeScript is one of the most widespread 
languages, in particular in web2 development. TypeScript, with its intuitive syntax and 
JavaScript compatibility, allows developers to draw on their existing skills and knowledge, 
thereby reducing the learning curve for building smart contracts on Massa.
Staking rewards come in the form of newly minted tokens, with a maximum of 1.02 Massa 
per slot. These rewards add up to a maximum of 64,377,504 Massa minted per year and 
distributed to active staking nodes, with a ratio of approximately 6.4% during the first year, 
and decreasing each year. In addition, staking nodes will share gas fees and slashed coins. 
As less than the total coin supply is anticipated to be staked at any given moment, the 
actual annual yield for active stakers should surpass this percentage.


To preserve decentralization in Massa and thanks to the low hardware and staking 
requirements, we do not need to implement delegations. Without delegation, the only 
way to access the staking rewards is to directly run a node. Also, centralized custodial 
staking providers are limited in size thanks to the community charter. Hence, running 
nodes to validate and control the blockchain becomes significantly more incentivized, 
with staking rewards earmarked solely for the node runners.
Technology
18
In 2022, 34% of developers have used typescript while blockchain-specific languages 
such as Solidity, Cairo or Move have a negligible developer base. Given that all Web2 
developers are already familiar with TypeScript, Massa is well-positioned to easily attract 
and integrate new developers. This decision has fostered an environment conducive to 
efficient and secure smart contract development, while also making it accessible for 
those familiar with JavaScript. This approach demonstrates Massa's commitment to 
nurturing a robust, secure, and developer-friendly ecosystem, positioning itself to draw a 
wide array of developers and foster a dynamic, innovative blockchain community.


Massa addresses today's blockchain scalability and accessibility challenges by solving the 
blockchain trilemma, reducing entry barriers, making staking attractive, and providing a 
developer-friendly stack.


Innovation is integral to Massa's ethos, ensuring it remains cutting-edge and poised to 
stay at the forefront of blockchain technology and usage. Massa has introduced two 
significant innovations that warrant individual discussion: autonomous smart contracts 
and on-chain web.


Massa demonstrated its innovative capacity and will continue to anticipate future trends 
and challenges, enabling it to incorporate new mechanisms that enhance usability or 
performance without compromising decentralization.
Technology
Autonomous Smart Contracts
Massa’s autonomous smart contracts (ASCs) are a groundbreaking innovation in the 
blockchain ecosystem, pushing the boundaries of decentralization and opening up new 
possibilities for a wide range of applications. ASCs are designed with a unique architecture 
that allows them to function asynchronously and self-wake, without the need for explicit offchain human or bot interactions. 
 
Whereas traditional smart contracts rely on external triggers to initiate actions, Massa's ASCs 
can register actions for later execution and emit signal events that other contracts can listen 
to. When an event is triggered, the corresponding handler functions are automatically 
executed, reducing the need for bots or human interaction and pushing the limits of 
decentralization.
19
Example of a bot trading on a DEX. With Massa’s autonomous smart contracts, the bot lives 
on-chain, with no need for a centralized server, and reacts instantly to changes on the DEX.
Autonomous Smart Contracts
20
To achieve this level of autonomy, Massa employs a combination of innovative features. 
Timers and Schedulers in Massa's ASCs enable them to schedule tasks for future 
execution, allowing for time-based actions to be performed autonomously. This feature 
allows smart contracts to wake up and execute tasks at predetermined intervals or 
specific times. Event Listeners are also present in Massa's ASCs, allowing them to listen 
for specific events emitted by other smart contracts and react to changes in the 
blockchain environment. This functionality enables the creation of interconnected and 
dynamic decentralized applications. 


The implementation of autonomous smart contracts on Massa addresses the limitations 
of traditional blockchain platforms, which are unable to compute autonomously and only 
execute requests from external sources. Developers have had to build complex 
workarounds, such as centralized services like Gelato, to overcome these limitations. 
Massa's ASCs eliminate the need for such centralized solutions, allowing for more 
decentralized, efficient, and secure operations. The benefits of ASCs on Massa are 
numerous, including enhanced decentralization, as the reliance on off-chain human or bot 
interactions is reduced. 
Use Case 1: DeFi
Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, is an arena where the transformative potential of Massa's 
autonomous smart contracts is fully realized. These unique contracts empower applications 
to harness the exclusive advantages of DeFi, such as increased transparency, security, and 
decentralization.


Developers can now build innovative DApps such as the ecosystem project Dusa, which is a 
pioneering decentralized exchange (DEX) with automatic order execution. Leveraging 
Massa's autonomous smart contracts, it is possible to execute limit orders without the need 
for centralized keeper bots, enhancing both the security and decentralization of the platform. 
This advancement improves the user experience by allowing assets to be sold at a set limit 
price, circumventing consensus delays, bot failure points, or competition from other sell 
orders.


The advantages extend to automated order execution, which is streamlined by Massa's 
autonomous smart contracts. These contracts also enhance interoperability. Their 
integration enables seamless interaction between different decentralized applications on the 
Massa platform, creating a DeFi ecosystem that is more cohesive and dynamic.

Use Case 2: NFTs and Games
The potential of autonomous smart contracts in the realm of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) 
and games is tremendous, and it is an area where Massa can revolutionize the gaming 
experience and streamline the NFT market. For instance, Massa's ASCs can facilitate 
autonomously breeding virtual pets like CryptoKitties, creating a dynamic and immersive 
gaming experience. The technology can also generate AI-created NFT art that evolves 
and learns on its own, offering new possibilities for digital art collectors and enthusiasts.


Decentralized in-game economies can benefit from Massa's ASCs by operating 
autonomously, allowing for more complex and engaging gaming experiences. By removing 
the need for centralized control, these economies become more resistant to manipulation 
and hacking. Furthermore, autonomous smart contracts on Massa can facilitate seamless 
interaction between different games and NFT platforms, fostering a more interconnected 
and vibrant gaming ecosystem.


Massa's autonomous smart contracts represent a groundbreaking innovation in the 
blockchain space, offering new possibilities for decentralized finance, non-fungible 
tokens, and games.

On-Chain Web and Massa Station
The proliferation of decentralized applications (DApps) has spurred numerous advancements 
in the digital sphere – yet, a vast majority of DApps still rely on centralized servers for hosting 
their front-end components, leading to security and reliability issues. Massa Station, an onchain web access tool built for the Massa blockchain, addresses these concerns by providing 
an intuitive platform for creating and interacting with DApps entirely on-chain. This unique 
approach has the potential to revolutionize the development, security, and adoption of 
decentralized applications, setting the stage for a truly decentralized web.


Centralized websites are fraught with various issues, including single points of failure and 
vulnerability to hacks. For instance, in December 2021, a BadgerDAO website hack led to a 
staggering $120m loss. Similarly, in August 2022, a front-end hack of Curve Finance resulted 
in a $575k loss. These incidents underscore the necessity for more secure and decentralized 
solutions for crucial applications such as DeFi platforms.


Massa Station counters these challenges by offering a tool that enables developers to build 
and host their projects directly on the Massa blockchain. By doing so, it eliminates reliance 
on centralized servers, mitigating the risks of censorship and hacking while providing a 
seamless Web3 experience for users. Developers can register ".massa" domains and store 
their websites' logic directly on the Massa blockchain, ensuring applications are accessible 
directly from any browser of a user who installed Massa Station, without any intermediaries. 
This innovative approach bolsters the security and reliability of critical applications, like DeFi 
platforms; Dusa, a project in the Massa ecosystem, distinguishes itself in the DeFi landscape 
with its decentralized front-end, ensuring resistance to censorship and hacks.

creation of unique, easily recognizable web addresses for on-chain websites and 
applications, enhancing their discoverability and credibility in the decentralized web 
ecosystem.
\& Back-End Hosting:
With its custom-built smart contract engine, Massa supports the development and 
hosting of smart contracts in TypeScript, a robust and widely-used programming 
language. This feature offers developers a familiar environment for creating the back-end 
logic of their DApps while ensuring the integrity and security of the underlying blockchain 
infrastructure. Moreover, the autonomous smart contract capability allows for fully 
autonomous back-end operations, akin to what a web2 server would be able to do, 
transitioning from a static database-like approach to a complete stack, genuine web3 
service.
& Front-End Hosting
In addition to back-end hosting, Massa enables developers to design and host their 
application's front-end directly on the blockchain, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other 
familiar web technologies. This feature allows for the creation of user-friendly, visually 
appealing interfaces for DApps. By hosting front-end components on-chain, Massa 
eliminates the need for third-party hosting services and ensures that the user interface 
remains consistent with the decentralized nature of the underlying application.
Ì& Seamless User Experience:
Massa Station's on-chain web access solution allows users to interact with DApps through 
their preferred web browsers, providing a seamless transition between web2 and web3 
experiences. By hosting both the front-end and back-end components of DApps directly on 
the Massa blockchain, users can enjoy a consistent and secure browsing experience without 
the need for intermediary services or third-party hosting providers.

Principles of Decentralized Governance on Massa
The Massa blockchain is not tied to any central legal entity or jurisdiction. It is owned and 
governed by Massa token holders. The Massa Foundation and the Massa Labs company 
are part of a decentralized ecosystem of actors with the common goal of growing the 
Massa ecosystem, its use cases, traction and token value.
 
These entities will participate in the core decisions impacting the network, as any other 
actor of the ecosystem voting with their own tokens. We present here the core DAO and 
the role of the different entities.
Massa Core DAO
We call core governance the decision processes of Massa token holders impacting the 
way the blockchain works. These decisions may generate updates on the Massa ledger, 
parameters, algorithms, tokenomics and community charter or other unforeseen 
components of Massa. The community of token holders participating in these decisions is 
therefore called the Massa Core DAO.
Governance
The Core DAO is not yet implemented on the blockchain, it is expected to be integrated by 
the end of 2024. It will use on-chain proposals with voting based on staked coins. For a 
proposal to pass, it will require votes from more than half of the active staked coins. Proposals 
will include automatic or non-automatic consequences. Automatic consequences can be for 
instance to increase the balance of the address of a project being granted, to remove the 
data of a smart contract harmful to the ecosystem, to change the roll price, etc. Nonautomatic consequences can be to integrate the proposal voting system, or to update the 
consensus algorithm or the virtual machine in ways that were not anticipated. The latter will 
require manual updates to the core blockchain code.


One expected role of the Core DAO, if the token holders desire so, is to provide additional 
funding to the ecosystem, either directly to builders’ projects, or through funding entities, 
such as the Massa Foundation or any other alternative funding entity. This funding may 
come from newly minted Massa tokens, from a percentage of the gas fees from operations, or 
both, as token holders see fit.
30
Massa Foundation
The Massa Foundation, being incorporated in Geneva, Switzerland, is a vital component in 
the Massa ecosystem. Its main responsibility is fostering the ecosystem's growth while 
safeguarding its core principle of decentralization. The Foundation's operations will 
primarily be funded through proceeds from the public sale and the decentralization 
program.


In its early stages, the Foundation will orchestrate various incentive programs to stimulate 
both the Massa community and the wider ecosystem. These programs include testnet, 
airdrops, bounties, ambassadorship, and grants. In addition, the Foundation will ensure 
compliance with the Massa community charter and oversee the distribution of the 
decentralization pool.


The Foundation’s grant program is designed to bootstrap the ecosystem in the first years 
of its infancy, funding projects building on Massa or in relation to Massa. The grant 
committee of the Foundation will decide to allocate grants based on grantee’s application 
and based on the community feedback on the potential project. The grant program is 
funded by part of the Community and Ecosystem allocation. More details on the topics 
that will be funded in priority are given in the Community and Ecosystem section.
Governance
Massa Labs
Massa Labs is the original company behind the Massa project, it was created in 2020. After 
initial research, Massa Labs raised €5m in a seed round in 2021 to develop the full blockchain 
stack and to bootstrap the community. Massa Labs’ role is to provide features, maintenance 
and security updates to the first Massa blockchain client and to the first Massa tools.


The Massa Foundation will provide funding to Massa Labs to continue its work on the 
blockchain client and tools after the mainnet launch. In order to decentralize the 
development of the blockchain and its tools, it is expected that the Foundation also funds 
other development entities when the development ecosystem matures and diversifies.

Community Charter
At Massa, our commitment to the foundational principles of blockchain - security, 
transparency, self-governance, and above all, decentralization - has always been 
unwavering. This steadfast belief in these values shapes every step we take and every 
decision we make. We owe it to our vibrant community, the lifeblood of our ecosystem, to 
stay true to this commitment.


That's why we're thrilled to announce a significant milestone in our journey - the Massa 
Community Charter. Set to be integrated into Massa's ledger, this Charter embodies our 
resolve to foster a truly decentralized and inclusive environment for all our users. It 
provides a clear framework for our community to understand our position on important 
aspects of our ecosystem, guiding us in upholding the values we hold dear.


One critical area the Charter addresses is our stand on practices that potentially sidestep 
our standards of decentralization. In our continued quest for a truly decentralized 
environment, it's essential we scrutinize and address potential attempts to subvert this 
decentralization, through clever maneuvers that could lead to significant centralization 
within the system.


In this section, we will shed light on such practices, exploring their implications and why 
we, at Massa, believe it necessary to prohibit them as per our Community Charter. As we 
traverse this complex landscape, our goal is to deepen our shared understanding of these 
issues and reinforce our unwavering commitment to the core principles of blockchain.
Community Charter
The Spirit of Decentralization and the Potential Pitfalls
Decentralization is the lifeblood of blockchain technology. It enables a trustless, 
permissionless network where power and control are distributed evenly among all 
participants. However, the evolution and growth of blockchain projects sometimes introduce 
challenges to this ideal. It's not unusual for practices that seem to deviate from the core spirit 
of decentralization to arise, often masked as measures for convenience or efficiency.


Consider a scenario where a third-party, either centralized or decentralized, offers a service 
that allows users to transfer their tokens to a specific address. This third party then adds 
these tokens to one or more of its validator nodes on the network. At first glance, this may 
seem beneficial, particularly to users who may not have the resources to run their own 
nodes. However, this seemingly benign service could inadvertently lead to significant 
centralization.


As users transfer their tokens to this third party, they effectively relinquish their share of the 
network's control to a single entity. This entity can then grow disproportionately influential 
by controlling a large portion of the network's validator nodes, contrary to our ethos of 
decentralization. This situation could threaten the network's resilience and even its 
governance, as this entity could wield considerable voting power.
32
Safeguarding Decentralization: Our Measures
At Massa, we don't just talk about decentralization, we act to protect it. To ensure that our 
vision remains strong and secure, we have codified certain guidelines in our Community 
Charter. The Charter will be made available ahead of the mainnet launch, allowing our 
community to familiarize themselves with its contents and principles. We describe its main 
mechanisms here.


One of the main centralization factors in blockchains is custodial staking, by which users 
deposit coins to centralized entities –banks, such as exchange platforms and staking 
providers, which stake their aggregate coins. This staking is done with or without users’ 
consent, often giving them a part of the staking rewards and sometimes not. As a result, a few 
centralized exchange platforms and staking providers together control 20 to 50% of most 
blockchain networks, from the block production to voting power in proposals. This behavior 
annihilates the block rewards incentive put in place to motivate people to run independent 
nodes, secure the network and participate in governance.
Community Charter
At Massa, our system has been designed to avoid any form of Delegated Proof of Stake 
(DPoS) mechanism. This decision is a conscious effort to prevent the emergence of overly 
influential entities that could undermine the network's decentralization. Unfortunately, 
the service described above is a clever method to sidestep this prohibition, creating a de 
facto DPoS situation.


The Charter, therefore, expresses our disapproval of such practices. It serves as a 
foundational pillar of our governance, safeguarding our decentralization principles.  
This document delineates the boundaries of our operations, acting as a robust and legally 
sound framework that preserves the integrity of our network against actions that could 
compromise our commitment to decentralization. By aligning our practices with the 
Charter, we stay true to our mission and vision, ensuring our community members the 
benefits of a genuinely decentralized ecosystem.
33
Our Community Charter is not just an aspirational document; it's an instrumental tool in our 
ecosystem. It lays down a set of clear rules for everyone within the Massa network. The 
Charter does not only illustrate our commitment to decentralization, but it also signifies our 
stance against any activities that could potentially compromise this ideal. The Charter 
provides a fundamental framework that defends and reinforces our vision of decentralization.


Moreover, we firmly believe that education and awareness serve as the best defenses 
against any practices that could undermine our pledge to decentralization. Our community 
lies at the heart of Massa, and an informed community member is our strongest ally. 
Therefore, we dedicate substantial effort to educate our community about our values, the 
significance of decentralization, and how to discern practices that could threaten it. We 
encourage regular interactions, discussions, and educational campaigns within our 
community to make sure everyone understands the importance of a truly decentralized 
network and their part in preserving it.
Community Charter
To prevent this behavior and protect decentralization, we designed the Massa 
Community Charter. This Charter applies to all members of the Massa community and in 
particular node runners. The goal of this Charter is to protect the interest of the Massa 
community, expressing that decentralization of staking is a key collective concern, and 
excluding the behavior of staking coins on behalf of other people above a significant 
threshold: 1,000,000 Massa in aggregate.


The Community Charter is not tied to any legal entity, it is included in the ledger and 
implicitly accepted when participating in the community and in particular when running 
nodes and connecting to the network. In the future, when the governance is 
implemented in the core blockchain, it is expected that the community of token holders 
will be able to update the Charter automatically through a proposal and votes of the 
Massa core DAO.


Any infringement to the community charter can trigger legal action by any party feeling 
damaged by this behavior. The Massa Foundation will monitor the state of 
decentralization in the Massa ecosystem and in particular the staking component of the 
Massa blockchain stack.


Note that while custodial staking is discouraged, solo staking is made very accessible, as 
we discussed in the previous technical section, such that holders are incentivized to stake 
and help secure the decentralized network.
34
Towards a Fully Decentralized Future with Massa
The principles enshrined in our Massa Community Charter reflect our enduring commitment 
to decentralization, a commitment we believe is fundamental for the future of blockchain 
technology. This future is only possible with an active, educated, and engaged community 
supporting and advocating these values.


By issuing the Charter, we not only lay out clear rules to guide our community in their 
participation but also reaffirm our position against activities that compromise our vision of a 
truly decentralized network.


Maintaining this strong stance against practices that jeopardize decentralization is our 
collective responsibility. We firmly believe that by empowering our community with the 
knowledge and tools to uphold this commitment, we are one step closer to a more 
transparent, democratic, and decentralized future.


With the support of our community, the path forward for Massa is clear. We will continue to 
grow, innovate, and lead the charge towards a decentralized future. Our Community Charter 
is just the start. Together, we can shape the blockchain landscape, ensuring Massa stands as 
a beacon of decentralization, now and for years to come.
Community Charter
The Vital Role of the Community in Upholding Decentralization
Massa's vision of a truly decentralized network is only possible through the active 
participation of our community. Our network thrives on the collective effort of each 
community member to uphold the principles of decentralization. Every user in the Massa 
network, from a single token holder to a node operator, has a unique role to play in 
maintaining our ecosystem's decentralized structure. It's a collective responsibility that 
calls for a collaborative spirit.


Moreover, our users aren't just passive participants; they're active contributors to our 
mission. They directly contribute to the network's security and robustness. Even in their 
interactions with each other and in making decisions about network governance, they 
embody the principle of decentralization that we so fiercely advocate.


Yet, this role comes with the responsibility to act against practices that could undermine 
our commitment to decentralization. The Massa Community Charter acts as a guide for 
our community in identifying such practices and responding appropriately. We ask each 
Massa community member to be vigilant, to stay educated, and to respect the principles 
laid out in our Charter.


By standing together as a community committed to our mission, we can ensure the 
continued success of a truly decentralized Massa.
35
Tokenomics
Massa, true to its values, has implemented a unique tokenomics model that emphasizes 
fairness and decentralization. This model ensures that the Massa token is distributed widely 
among the community, reducing the risk of centralization that can result in unfair voting 
practices, price manipulation, and security compromises:
b Unfairly-distributed voting: When a small number of entities control a significant 
portion of a blockchain's tokens, they can disproportionately influence governance 
decisions, undermining the democratic principles that underpin decentralized systems/
b Price manipulation: Token centralization can also lead to price manipulation, as large 
holders can exert undue influence on the market, creating artificial fluctuations that 
distort the true value of the token/
b Security compromises: A centralized token distribution can lead to security 
vulnerabilities, as malicious actors can target the limited number of entities controlling a 
large portion of the token supply. It also generates centralization in block production, 
leading to protocol-level risks.
Massa is committed to maintaining the highest standards of decentralization, with the 
goal to achieve a Nakamoto coefficient of over 1,000, ensuring that control and decisionmaking power are widely distributed across the community. Achieving this not only 
requires efforts on the technical and legal design, but also on the coin distribution. On this 
aspect, we crafted three main particularities compared to other L1 blockchain coin 
distributions:
These steps together improve the token decentralization, limit the influence of early 
insiders and VCs, and limit the formation of whales whose only remaining option is to buy 
on the market.
b Less tokens for the company/founders: Massa Labs and founders are allocated 12% 
of the total supply/
b Less tokens for insiders: The maximum number of tokens bought per entity in all our 
token sales is relatively small. For instance, the cap was 1% of the total supply in the 
seed sale, allowing a record number of 100 backers in such a sale. Also, the supply 
allocated to these private sales is only 16% in total/
b More tokens for future builders and stakers: the Decentralization Program sets 
aside 30% of the supply to grow the future builders and stakers community, with the 
aim to achieve full decentralization in a transparent way.
Tokenomics
36
Massa Token
The Massa token is the native token of the Massa L1 blockchain. It has three main uses in 
the blockchain: it serves as gas for operations so that nodes include them into blocks, it 
can be staked to give power to a node to create blocks in the Massa blockchain, and in 
the future it will be used to propose changes and to vote in the Massa Core DAO.
Initial Token Distribution
The total initial token supply is 1,000,000,000 Massa tokens. These initial tokens are set 
up in the genesis ledger. They are distributed as follows.

months are burnt.
Nakamoto Coefficient Computation
Thanks to the fair distribution with smaller pools for insiders and larger pools dedicated 
to the community, the Nakamoto coefficient of Massa is well over 1,000.
¹ Massa Labs: 12%, at least 100 peopleÆ
¹ Private sales: 16%, at least 100 peopleÆ
¹ Community and Ecosystem: 18%, at least 1,000 peopleÆ
¹ 2k-builders Program: at least 800 people in the 4% to go to 50% (other remaining 
categories have more people, e.g. Testnet Incentive: at least 2,000 people in 4%).
With this data, we can compute the Nakamoto coefficient of the coin after distribution. The 
Nakamoto coefficient is computed as the minimum number of independent entities/persons 
required to reach 50% of the total supply. We take the most concentrated categories and 
count the expected number of entities/people until we reach 50%:
Tokenomics
If the node is offline for some reason, it misses the opportunity to produce the block and to 
get the reward. If the node is missing these opportunities too often, it is automatically 
deactivated and its rolls are lost and fully given back as coins. If the node produces more 
than one block in a selected slot, this is considered as bad behavior and is punished with 
slashing: one roll is slashed, completely lost and no coins are given back.


At each slot, one staking address is selected to produce a block, and in order to improve 
consensus speed, 16 other addresses are selected to create endorsements —votes about the 
best blocks. A maximum minted reward of 1.02 tokens is distributed per slot. If there was a 
block in this slot, the reward is distributed as follows:
38
Staking Rewards
Staking is the process of running a validator node verifying the blockchain and creating 
blocks. In Massa as in other Proof-of-Stake blockchains, nodes are selected to create 
blocks based on their deposited coins –their stake in the blockchain.


As staking improves the decentralization and security of the network, this behavior is 
incentivized by staking rewards: the higher the number of staked coins, the higher the 
number of created blocks and received rewards.


To improve decentralization and dedicate rewards to independent node runners, there is 
no delegation mechanism in Massa, and custodial staking is limited by the community 
charter.


A minimum number of coins must be deposited to be able to stake, corresponding to one 
roll. The number of coins in a roll is set to 100. Users deposit coins to get a number of rolls 
and stake with these rolls. When they want to stop staking, they can get back their coins 
after a small locking period and lose the corresponding rolls. When the staking address is 
selected to produce a block, the node is expected to produce exactly one block.
Block and endorsement creators also share the gas fees of all transactions included in the 
block, and half of the slashed coins, the other half being burnt. However, all the fees of 
autonomous smart contracts are burnt as they run outside blocks.

Tokenomics

There are 2 slots per second in Massa architecture, so these rewards add up to a 
maximum of 64,377,504 newly-minted Massa tokens per year, distributed to active staking 
nodes. The inflation rate is therefore approximately 6.4% during the first year, and 
decreases each year as the total supply increases.


As less than the total supply is expected to be staking at any point in time, the actual 
return per year for active stakers will be higher than this percentage. The next figure 
shows the maximum inflation rate and an estimation of the annual percentage return 
(APR) for staking nodes over time.
Launch Staking
On mainnet launch, the genesis ledger distributes coins to the different holders, and also 
includes genesis rolls granting staking rights for the first cycles. For the utmost community 
involvement and decentralization, genesis rolls will be allocated to node runners from the 
testnet incentive program who showed success in stable testnet staking and who are willing 
to be part in the creation of the first blocks of the mainnet. These node runners will have their 
coin rewards from the testnet program converted to rolls in the genesis ledger.
Massa's tokenomics model is designed to ensure a fair and decentralized token distribution, 
contributing to the platform's overall security, sustainability, and user empowerment. By 
allocating a significant portion of its tokens to the public, Massa fosters widespread 
community engagement and ownership, reducing the risks associated with token 
centralization.

Massa Genesis
Sébastien, Damir, and Adrien started the Massa project in 2017 as a research endeavor on 
consensus protocols. Their primary aim was to resolve the scalability issues of blockchains, all 
while maintaining its fundamental principle—decentralization. The Massa Labs company was 
founded later in 2020, accelerating the protocol development with a growing team of 
dedicated developers. Additional information about the project's genesis is available in the 
 blog post.


As the story goes, there are two origins to the Massa name. The first origin traces back to the 
MAΣΣA coins minted 2,500 years ago in Massalia. Founded by a Greek colony, Massalia was 
an autonomous city minting its own silver coins. The coins typically featured a lion on one 
side and Artemis on the other side. Now Marseille, it is also the city where Damir and 
Sébastien first crossed paths and pursued their studies. The second inspiration for the Massa 
name is that it also signifies “Mass adoption”, reflecting the ultimate goal of this 
decentralized independent currency.

Roadmap
Since the project's inception in 2017, we have focused on achieving the necessary 
technical milestones, propelled by years of research and community-driven testnet 
enhancements. With these milestones accomplished, the mainnet is now being prepared 
as we embark on a new chapter. While the next steps are in sight, the future direction will 
be charted by the Massa community itself.


The Massa public sale and mainnet launch, expected in Q4 2023, represent the most 
significant upcoming events. The Massa Foundation will be established in time to oversee 
the birth of the ecosystem. At launch, listing on exchanges will serve to bridge Massa to 
the blockchain ecosystem at large.


After mainnet, the integration of on-chain governance into the core blockchain is the next 
key feature anticipated in 2024. The core governance will empower the Massa community 
to independently determine and implement its collective will.


The community will choose the next directions for technical upgrades, potentially 
focusing on scalability and enhancing user experience. In this respect, we will explore L2 
and sharding solutions to scale Massa further, and study decentralized interoperability 
and account abstraction to improve user experience.


By year eight through mainnet, the decentralization program will end, handing full control 
over to the community and marking the ultimate decentralization step.
