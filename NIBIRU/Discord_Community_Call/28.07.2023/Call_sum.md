## Nibiru Discord Community Call 28.07.2023
`Summary`
###


**Testnet Feedback**
> The Incentivized Testnet has been running since mid-February and helped improve the system's throughput and stability under load. Over 70 million transactions have been processed, with over 120,000 users interacting through the web application. More than 30,000 smart contracts were deployed and invoked during the third phase of the testnet.

**When**
> A trading competition is planned as the last phase before the token launch. The team is also considering an IEO and other methods to ensure the token is easily accessible. The token launch is planned for the fall.

**Security Measures**
> The team has conducted security audits that have covered all endpoints, node health, the Oracle module, the Perp module, and all smart contracts that will run alongside the initial apps in production.

**Ecosystem**
> Nibiru is not a DEX only, it aims to attract builders to create a variety of DApps on top of it. The team is developing a few DApps that will launch with the chain to attract a developer ecosystem. The team is also working on a "super app" concept, aiming to integrate all DeFi aspects into one single platform. Nibiru differentiates itself by offering additional incentives on top of the normal staking rewards.

**Partnerships and Expansion**
> The team is working on partnerships with various entities, including Dora Hacks, Keplr, Axelar and others. The team is also exploring ways to leverage IBC to partner with teams like Evmos, Injective, and Kava.

**Community Engagement**
> The team has an ambassador program to improve communication and collaboration with its users.
