, as well as sharing the latest updates. If you have any questions, feel free to request to speak on 
stage or just drop it in the chat so we'll be able to answer your questions live as well. You have Unique 
Divine today as our speaker, who is also our co founder, so he's best positioned to answer all the 
questions you may have. So, yeah, let's get started. 1s The first question is about test night. As you may 
know, we have been running incentivized test night since mid February. Lots of progress have been made 
and we have achieved couple milestones as well. So lots of people are wondering where we are these 
days, in particular, a community member by the name of Sanders Rack. He asked, how did the test night 
help on achieving different targets? What improvements were made based on the feedback of the 
community? Unique, would you like to help with that question?
1:12
Sure. 3s So one I think was testing the system under load. So we improved the throughput of the chain 
pretty substantially between the Cosmos Hub or Terra's initial block time down to what it is that you see 
on the testnet and wanted to be sure that these changes wouldn't bring about networking, stability or 
cause validators to get slashed from an absurdly low finality time. So having the chance to make 
iterations and keep things stable for node operators without sacrificing on decentralization or requiring 
colocation was a big win. 3s If you probably remember from a previous update, we developed an indexer 
that listens on the WebSocket and stores all of the transactions and events in a SQL database. So for the 
testnet we have a lot of statistics that we basically found. So some of those are there were 70 million plus 
transactions on the Incentivized testnet so far and 1s 120,000 or more users that went through the web 
application and a lot more that we saw in terms of the addresses on the chain. So. 1s A couple of things 
people did were testing out the price feeder binary for the Oracle module that's incentivized on main net, 
but it's extra work on the testnet, so we're really thankful that people did that throughout ITN. And then 
also as part of the third phase, more than 30,000 Smart contracts were deployed and invoked and 
governance was super active as well, so so basically we source a lot of the additional engineering tasks 
for user experience. Improvements and bug fixes from our bugs at Nebrewfi email, but also forming 
GitHub issues and then the channels both for feedback and that we have in the discord. A lot of the 
ambassadors and community mods help us organize and keep track of them. So we definitely do source 
tasks from the testnet.
3:26
Gotcha. Yeah, we're really happy with the numbers we're seeing so far with over 70 million transactions 
on the incentivized testnet and over 30,000 smart contracts were deployed and invoked. So also grateful 
to our ambassador and mods who really helped us with a lot of things and I already see a couple of 
familiar faces in the audience as well. So really thank you for your continued support. We feel really 
pumped for the future. Absolutely. Which brings out my next question actually, and I think this is a 
question of major interest that we're seeing lots of people asking us about Midnight Wind Token. So 
unique. Can you help shed some light on that question?
4:14
On when token when
U1
U2
U1
U2
4:17
token women night.
4:18
Yeah. So when token is a common question. 1s You guys have been pretty patient with us in terms of 
this for the launch. So basically I'll do a kind of highlight a few milestones. So the major things in the 
work now are that we have a trading competition coming up, which is kind of like the last phase. 2s If 
you looked at the recent releases for the version 21 binary, we upgraded to Cosmos SDK version 47. And 
so that has different challenges with the nodes that we're kind of addressing before we give the binary 
out. But that's kind of like the last step before this trading competition, how that kind of works. Of course 
we'll give a lot more details, maybe give it its own AMA, but essentially there'll be a huge body of 
winners with different tiers. And I think we set it to like 1000 if I look at my notes. And so basically we'll 
look at the percentage PNL. So 2s it's not something that would be necessarily gamble by just getting a 
bunch of money from the faucet and make more money. It's more like, how well does somebody actually 
trade with the capital they have? That way it's more fair for different users and people that aren't 
validators. And then beyond that, a few of these are just like in the works, so they're not finalized. I don't 
have specific names, but we're looking to do the initial exchange offering. Going to be talking about 
maybe doing a coin list thing for the token for getting initial liquidity. So we're trying to make sure that 
it's easy to access 1s the chain and the token, not just that it's only in one location. And so the launch 
timeline we're aiming for this fall, so it's actually right around the corner. So we're coming up main net 
launch, actually.
6:23
Thanks for giving that update. Yeah, keep an eye out for our next phase, which is a trading competition. 
This will be huge because these are grand finale of the incentivized ties night. 1s So, like Nibiru just 
mentioned a lot know the parameters to decide the winners will be based on P L instead of just like 
volume. So this will help us identify the real trade years. And I can also give a teaser as well that this 
trading competition will accommodate many, many users much more than what we have done before. 
And winners will be able to accumulate large amounts of points compared to all the other previous feasts. 
So definitely keep in mind of the trading competition and we'll be notifying you as soon as we're ready. 1s
Okay, so let's talk about security a little bit in terms of the security measures, what we have done so far to 
ensure a successful midnight launch. Have there been any audits?
7:34
I think it's muted, but yeah. So Salad Security did pen testing audits on all of our endpoints and node 
health, and we did a pretty large audit with Zelek, so that has concluded. We didn't put the announcement 
up yet, but yeah, they basically audited the Oracle module, the Perp module, and all of these smart 
contracts that we would run alongside 1s the initial apps in production. 3s We were pretty happy with 
their team, so they did, like, an awesome job. We just did the exit interview earlier this week, actually, so 
yeah, more details on that.
8:20
Great. I saw 1s one member is asking to speak, so let's get him up on the stage ASA.
U1
U2
U1
U2
U1
U2
8:32
Sure.
8:50
ASA. Let me know when you're on the stage. I already invite you to speak. 11s I think you need to accept 
the invite in order to be on the stage. 12s All right. I don't know. Maybe it's not working for him. Let's 
continue and then we'll get back to you ASA later. 2s So next question we have is about our ecosystem 
post midnight. When we think about the future of Nibiru, what can users expect? In particular, we also 
have a question from a community member. Will Nibiru position itself as Dex. Only or does a project 
plan to expand into other areas as well? And.
9:59
It? Yeah, that's a good question. So how I would think of it is 1s it's kind of a mixture between the 
general purpose chains and app one. So we're not trying to position as like a Dex only what I would think 
it's closest to is on 2s essentially the founding team is developing couple of DApps that launch with the 
chain and the idea is to make those compelling and competitive against different DApps and really 
bootstrap users and liquidity and attract a developer ecosystem around that through this sort of, like, 
super app. But in reality there's still 1s permissionless, smart contracts. So 1s another level to this is that 
you want to attract builders to make all sorts of DApps on top of it as well. So we're seeing this a lot with 
the hackathon in particular, kind of kickstarted some of this. So now in addition to the apps we're 
building, there are people working on lending Protocol, NFT, Marketplace, gaming, naming services, 
things like that. 1s So yeah, so a lot more than just the decks
11:17
and. You got you. So Dex is one of the Nibiru's core products, but Nibiru is also building the ecosystem, 
on top of which the various projects can build. On top of Nibiru and the hackathon, so far, we have 
received more than 40 submissions, so really excited about the progress the projects are making. You 
mentioned something about super app. Can you elaborate a little bit more on that concept?
11:46
Yeah, so this is kind of an idea where we're trying to port over 3s a lot of the products that have product 
market fit from a centralized exchange, but unify them in a fully decentralized back end. So the closest 
really, we're striving for something where it's kind of like Kucoin or Binance, except where you have 
lending OTC, spot derivatives, staking on and off ramps, all of that in one vertically integrated seamless. 
2s Um, so that's like a big undertaking. Of course, we wouldn't develop all of that as a team. The the first 
apps that our team is developing are kind of like the first few steps of that. 2s But yeah. So it's really like 
we're aiming for something that integrates everything. Almost like a WeChat. Right. So, yeah, got
12:50
you. That's really inspiring. So you're talking about 1s building a vertically integrated ecosystem that's 1s
encompassing all this fragmented, DeFi aspects into one single platform. So binance would be something 
akin to what you are talking about, but in a more decentralized manner.
U1
U2
U1
U2
U1
U2
13:17
Exactly. Yeah.
13:20
All right. That's really cool. I've noticed recently there is a narrative 1s saying that it's more advantages to 
build on ethereum layer two versus alternative layer ones. By which I mean on one side. ETH maxes say 
that it doesn't matter to compare the decentralization or security of an alt layer one to ether layer two if 
the ultimate value settlement still on ether layer one. On the flip side, others argue that this argument is 
only parroted by ether incumbent because ethereum cannot scale on its own, so there's no other option 
but to scale via additional chains with their own tokens attached. I'm curious, what's your take on this? 
Given that Nibiru is an alternative layer one, why did your team opt for this approach rather than building 
on polygon or Epitrum, for example?
14:17
It. Yeah. So I think that 3s the summary statement would be that building a sovereign one maximizes the 
combination of composability customization we need from an engineering side, the ability to scale and 
then community ownership over its potential versus what we would see on an L Two. So let's take in the 
case of Salana and Avalanche and in our chain and chains like Say, right, they're kind of designed from 
the ground up with scalability in mind so they can handle thousands of transactions per second natively, 
without even needing to go to a roll up or L Two at first. So I think that's one big advantage there's. Also, 
the architecture is a little simpler if you're just for using another L one, especially when you have, like, 
IBC, but even without, it's probably easier from a Bridging standpoint to do that than 1s having users and 
developers navigate the complexities associated with a combo L one, L Two versus just using the alt L 
One from their different security models. And then, of course, each of the when you have the L Two, 
like, was mentioned in your thing 2s in your initial question, ETH is 3s the L Two is beholden to the 
ETH security, which is like its advantage. But that also means that it's not like an independent blockchain 
network. So one approach of like, if you have an Alta one is a standalone blockchain with its own 
consensus mechanism. And so that also means you're potentially resistant to issues that could arise with 
other chains. So I think in terms of diversifying risk, there's an angle there. And that kind of helps with 
innovation as well, is because you can offer features or capabilities that aren't implemented on Ethereum. 
2s Often this is just toted for lower transaction fees. In our case, it's like faster block times. They also 
have different smart contracting languages. And then for us, our Oracle module and some of the capital 
Efficiencies brought about on the Perps exchange in particular wouldn't be possible if we were building 
on Ethereum. It 2s understood if you can pull it off, it's definitely much more beneficial to build on layer 
one than Ether layer two. Do you have any plans to integrate with layer two?
17:03
With other
17:07
guess 1s in a bridging sense, that's definitely on the roadmap. I know if we can do that with Seller or 
Wormhole, that would definitely or Axilar. If they support that, that would be one plan. But in a more 
direct context, I know we have an AMA coming up with the 2s with the Eclipse team, right? So in that 
case, we're exploring doing an EVM roll up so that people can deploy solidity smart contracts on the 
chain as opposed to just Cosmos. But yeah, that's more like in the earlier workings.
U1
U2
U1
U2
17:51
Got you. I guess many developers will be happy to know our ability to bring solidity developers over to 
the Bear ecosystem as well. So Nibiru chain is built on Cosmos SDK using Cosmosm. How does Nibiru's 
architecture and technical design differentiate itself from other cosmo SDK blockchains?
18:15
Yes. So one of them is 1s the proof of stake rewards are actually 2s there are additional incentives on top 
of the normal staking rewards. So how this kind of works is some of you that have been running nodes 
may have noticed that 2s there's like this X Oracle module. So how that kind of works is it's a commit 
reveal scheme where the native Oracle for the chain is maintained by validators posting prices. And 
essentially you take the reference price for the Oracle as the weighted median of all of the votes from the 
different validators and if they're too far outside of the reference price, they can be slashed and it's not as 
big as like double signing, it's a lot smaller. And then of course if they have lower too low of uptime it's 
same rules. So you may say why would they partake in this risk? Well one is 2s Validators are kind of 
the natural party to run extra infrastructure on the chain. So 2s in addition to the normal proof of stake 
rewards that they get some of the trading fees from in particular like the Perps application, but probably 
in other Legos that launch on the chain following 3s they move some of their fees over to the Oracle. 
And so what that means is in addition to the regular Staking rewards in Nibi, there's also some well in 
Perps case stablecoin. And because it's weighted by the voting power, that also means there's this nice 
economic feedback loop where you actually want to stake more Nibi because it means that you would 
earn more stablecoin rewards from the DAPs. It also means if the DAPs succeed a lot, the stakers and 
token holders of the network have a natural upside or their fates are tied together. Right? So if Nibi Perps 
does well, the Nibi token holders also do pretty well too. And that also means that Validators wouldn't 
need to dump their token emissions to pay for infra costs. So it kind of helps with having a natural way to 
incentivize 1s like and of course it's delegated proof of stake so all their stakers earn it too. You, so I 
think that's going to be probably one of the key differentiators because it means that there's like a 
sustainable economic model.
20:57
Yeah, I know the team has been doing the tokenomics for a while and just getting different advisors to 
work on it. When can we expect to see some more details about the Tokenomics?
21:14
Oh, I mean, the initial write up is 1s on the Doc site, but 1s add we can add more detail about the Oracle 
in particular under that section too, because I know right now only people who've been following the 
code base are probably aware of that. 1s Yeah,
21:34
sounds great. 2s Okay, next up we have about ecosystem expansion in terms of how to attract developers 
and users. We also got a question from community member. What incentives or support structure is 
Nibiru going to offer to attract unwritten developers and new users?
22:00
U1
U2
U1
U2
U1
U2
It got you. So there are both current and upcoming programs and incentives tailored to each group. So 
first I'll talk about the dev side. So we have the hackathon right now, which is kind of like our main one 
because we made sure that the prize pool is kind of flexible. We weren't sure how many people would 
participate. So we wanted there to be kind of like a minimum price, minimum set of prizes for if there 
aren't as many participants, but then if there are a lot or if someone wants to put a ton of effort or engage 
closely with the team made it so that 1s it can support prizes for a number of teams. Building DApps on 
the chain. 5s The chain is about to launch so it's in the early phases. But there is a grants program so 
anyone can just fill out an application and then we'll probably have a call and review it from there and 
that will continue on mainnet. And of course then there's developer. We put a lot of effort into having 
good developer tooling both for running a local chain but then also accessing through different clients 
and. 2s Yeah, if you want. We've also made it that people can set up almost like office hours or just ask 
us questions directly while building. So I think that kind of direct support will help a lot with developer 
retention as far as users. 2s So remember that 60% of the token supply is reserved for community 
initiatives. So the incentivized testnet is just like one example as our first major community engagement. 
But on top of this we have 1s an early AirDrop coming up like NFT distribution, probably an initial 
exchange offering. And then we have a ton of 2s reward incentive programs that will run throughout the 
main net. So one in particular is like that you can refer other people to get a discount on trading but then 
earn based on those other users that you refer. Or for people that are more of the influencer type of niche 
there's like an affiliate program as well. So then those would start with mainnet as well.
24:23
Wow, that sounds packed. Information with lots of just like basic details. 2s Awesome. So you talk a lot 
on the dive side about what is applying to attract developers. Let's get a little bit more technical so we 
know that Cosmosm is at the core of Nibiru platform. Could you provide examples of projects or 
applications that could particularly benefit from Nibiru's permissionless cosmo? Awesome.
24:57
Yeah, so personally I think the requiring permission goes a bit against the blockchain's ethos of 
decentralization, so we didn't want to stifle innovation or discourage teams from building with sovereign 
governance mechanisms on the chain. So I guess for example, to your question, this is probably 
particularly useful for other DeFi projects that want to have sovereign governance, whether that's 
something like Astroport or a lending DAP or gaming apps like what's being built in the hackathon. So 
just to going back to our point from last time, nebiru launches with certain native apps, but it's not an app 
chain, so permissionless contracts are going to help it drive greater adoption and network effects. 2s It
25:50
definitely greater adoption and network effect.
25:54
So
25:57
U1
U2
U1
U2
U1
since we're touching on the adoption and network effect, where are we these days about partnerships? I 
believe partnership is important in expanding the ecosystem and just help onboarding a wider audience. 
Can you shed some light on that regard as well?
26:18
Yeah, so I touched on this a little bit, and then we've had some recent 1s announcements come out. So 
basically we talked to, I guess if I were to laundry listing them. So working with Dora Hacks was 
definitely huge and helped Kickstart more external development. We got like Leap set up, but need to get 
native support set up for Kepler, so we need to talk to those teams. So wallets are one side, but 1s yeah, 
we're pretty close with the Cosmos station team, so we'll try to get that wallet support as well. Then from 
the Bridging side, we already did the integration with Axelr on the testnet and have relayers running, so 
that'll be supported early on main net. But it would be nice to have 1s Seller or Wormhole so that we can 
also connect to, like you mentioned before, like Ethel two S, Avalanche, things like that. Salana and then 
just met with C 14 yesterday. So they do like Fiat to crypto payment ramps and we haven't signed 
anything, but also talk with the Kado team. So 2s those are priorities as well, is that we don't want it to be 
difficult for people to access the chain. So I think ramps are a big important part of that. And then 
obviously, 1s we've been exploring ways to leverage IBC to partner with teams like Evmos, Injective and 
Kava. So a lot of that's still in the so we have AMAs coming up pretty soon on them, but I guess this is 
just like a teaser of some of the things you'll hear about pretty soon. All. You mentioned a couple of 
different partners in terms of the types. 1s So among all the different types of partners that you've got so 
far, how do you prioritize them?
28:14
I guess,
28:15
yeah, I think some of it is also 3s I think it's really you just get and have a conversation with them and 
then see which teams are more interested in collaborating. A lot of people, especially with a bear market, 
2s they're busy, but then it's also looking out for themselves. So not as much looking to partner. So I find 
that really, at least if you want the exact details, just keep a big list of all the partners on either a 
spreadsheet or in notion and then try to make sure that we're keeping tabs or interacting with each of 
them because it's really 1s kind of an aggressive strategy. We want to talk to all of them, not necessarily 
say that one is more important than the other. In this case, especially with an L one, 2s you want ramps, 
bridges, wallets, like other DApps, all of it. Right? Not just one more than the other.
29:23
Right, the grand of startup life. 5s So we've got another question. This is from a community member by 
the name of Dee. He asks, what initiatives has Nibiru taken to improve communication and collaboration 
with its users? But this is question on user communication and community side.
29:51
Yeah, 2s this is funny enough, this is usually your wheelhouse to do a lot of the stuff with the community 
collaboration. But I think one is the ambassador program helped a ton or more than we were expecting. 
So it was difficult for a smaller team like ours, that's very engineering heavy, to be able to engage the 
U2
U1
U2
U1
U2
community around the clock and in different languages. And having community mods or even just 
people making content, writing blogs, answering questions in the Discord 2s helped ensure that there was 
a communication channel between us and community members in East Asia, Russia, Europe, Africa, 
things like that. So we, we actually now have it that there's like a weekly meeting where we pull in a ton 
of the 1s well, one is those mods can ping us directly, but then also 1s we source a lot of people's 
concerns from the Discord and then just go address them. So I think the ambassador program particularly 
helped us kind of scale ourselves. 3s For such a large community. 3s Definitely. We have great 
ambassadors. By the way, I saw some newcomers. So if you want to ask live questions, feel free. You 
can raise your hand to speak on the stage. I'll get you on the stage. Or you can also just post it in the chat 
and we'll be able to say it. 1s So yeah, would love to see some interaction with you guys. So feel free. 
Next up, we have
31:38
question for node operators. We have Chetty and his question is, can the team design a better support 
system for node operators and newcomers? I found it a little bit hard to navigate when I joined
31:54
Gotcha. Yeah, I think something we did 2s throughout the time of the incentive assessment is we added 
endpoints to 1s just pull the binary directly from releases rather than needing to build it from scratch. So 
it is a lot easier to onboard to that now than even just like few months back. But of course it would be 
open to hearing other ways to 1s other resources we can provide to make the process more seamless.
32:36
Yeah, that's clear. 2s We also have a question on infrastructure. Will Nibiru support infrastructure 
components like decentralized storage Oracles or cloud computing?
32:51
I think if we are, this would be more something that's like in 2024, because there's already so much on 
the plate for this year. Just coming up with the main net launch and the other DApps building. But we 
have been exploring an infra angle with an early stage project that wants to supply 1s decentralized GPU 
usage. So I guess if that materializes into something, we'll probably talk about it. But yeah, from the infra 
side, it would be more so for next year, not in the immediate future.
33:29
And lastly, for developers, I'm speaking on behalf of our developers where can they go to get all the 
resources they need to build on top of Nibiru?
33:40
Gotcha. So some of these are hinted at in the docs, but I can list off a few. In particular here is there are 
separate repos for a few client SDKs that we have. So there's one in TypeScript, there's a Python SDK, 
and then more recently we have a Goling one as well. So those can let you do everything from like you 
using the WebSocket or in the case of the TypeScript one like setting up the wallet clients or building 
front ends for other applications. Python 1 may be more useful for traders or go right. And then also the 
U1
U2
U1
U2
U1
U2
Cosmosm Nibiru repo, like CW Nibiru serves as like a useful template on how to get started writing and 
compiling smart contract. It. It has a lot of commands for kind of abstracting away how you run the tests, 
make sure that everything is compatible with the Cosmosm standard and things like that. And then of 
course, we included tutorials and examples for each of these 1s and. Yeah. So those are kind of like a list 
of the main resources.
34:55
Got it. Yeah. We've done two workshops for hackathon so far, right, and both received lots of views, like 
over a thousand views on binance live. So what's the plan for future workshops and tutorials?
35:11
Yeah, probably continuing with the continuing along the vein for really the Cosmosm side. I know 
because not as many people are used to developing in Rust, so those are good. I think the second 
workshop on doing local testing and running a network is super useful as well because that lets you put a 
real chain with one validator but then test things live against it, 1s probably for future ones. I've seen that 
a few of the people in the hackathon were developing NFT based projects or marketplaces and so I think 
maybe doing a workshop showing people how to mint and use the CW 721 standard, which is just like, 
ERC, seven to one, basically for minting and creating NFTs may be useful. Well, 2s it would be a 
development tutorial, but it's also useful for particular teams that have everything centered around that.
36:16
Got it. Thanks for sharing. I've got one last question. I think this is actually more of a personal question, 
but I believe people here would be interested in hearing your thoughts as well. So you mentioned we'll be 
launching Midnight in the fall, right? Right around the fall. Some are there. How would you define, let's 
say, the immediate success of Midnight? What can people expect when we launch the Midnight
36:45
defining success for it? 4s Yeah, I think it's like if we can get a lot of excitement and usage and probably 
just 1s further DApps like launching on the chain, of course, I think a huge part of the success is just 
doing it without 1s halts or errors or anything going wrong from an infra side. So I think just getting a 
stable system going without issue will already be a win. But. 2s Yeah, I think growing the community 
and getting more people building would be the main indicators of success for the main net launch, too.
37:34
Yeah, 100%. Okay, with that being said, we'll leave the thought to the audience today. 1s I think that's 
probably the last question we have, so I'm just going to open the floor one last time to the audience. 
Whoever wants to speak on the stage, feel free or post your question in the chat. If not, is there any 
closing remarks or thoughts you want to share with us?
38:05
No, I think that covered it. 2s There was a ton of different topics, I guess. Did anyone from the audience 
have questions before we head out? 2s All right, let's give it 10 seconds.
U1
U2
U1
U2
U1
U2
38:26
Okay. Probably everybody's shy? 3s Yeah, everyone's shy. 1s Okay, 3s you have no questions and Alex 
says yep. Alex, you don't have to be shy. If you want to say something, say something. Anything you 
want. 2s Okay, great. Everybody, 1s it's a pleasure to be with you today, and thank you all for joining us. 
We'll see you next time.
39:09
So 2s this is shy. 4s All
39:18
right, bye, everyone. Bye
