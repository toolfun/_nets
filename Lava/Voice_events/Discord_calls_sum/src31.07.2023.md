staying active in the discord with our normal discord champs like Dapper, Erco, Ashpat, you 
know who you guys are. We really welcome you all. And I want to give also special shout outs to I'm 
going to try and pronounce this as K Barion, which we saw your Korean version of Lava's light paper in 
the Your Contributions channel. I don't have the Korean skills to review it, but we're super appreciative 
for that. I always say the work of translation just unlocks whole new communities to us. So I really 
appreciate, we all really appreciated Lava, the work that you've done. Shout out to one of our Dev 
champs who's on the call, ruslan Glasniov. He'll be giving a presentation later on in this call. He did a 
huge deed for Lava by adding cosmgs support for Lava SDK, the much sought after integration. So we're 
very appreciative. We want to show him a lot of love. Also shout out to Shoni for the great Twitter 
content. Congrats on the new provider. Shout out to Lesnik for the Lava providers and the contributions 
channel. Shout out to Milacorn 69, who great meme content. Actually made me chuckle when I saw your 
memes Yaroslav as normal and just everyone else who's been helping, we've got over 160 community 
run provider nodes. It's a very exciting time for Lava as we continue to expand and grow in this testnet. 
We've got a lot of exciting updates right around the corner. So shout out, as always, to our lovely, 
beautiful community who puts in the hard work of making this a fun place to be and really connecting 
each other. So thank you to everyone, all our providers, developers, validators users of Lava, shout out to 
you. 1s I also saw Alexa sneak on the call, and I believe he had a birthday recently. So you get your shout 
out as well, as well as to our moderators. Thanks, man. Yeah, absolutely. Happy birthday. 3s Now we'll 
move on to our section where we do calls to action. Calls to action is anything that. We want people in 
our community to see. The first is that if you're new to Lava and want to find out an easy way to connect 
deeply with us, check out our zeeli. You'll be able to see plenty of quests and activities that will intro you 
to Lava, let you know the important places and spaces to connect to, and it's just a great way to really 
engage. So I would definitely, if you haven't already checked out the zeeli, see if you can make it on that 
leaderboard. Additionally, the SDK is in public alpha. We have a new UX and quality of use 
improvements. You'll see that now you can actually generate a wallet from the browser using the 
gateway 1s instead of needing to install Lava D onto your local machine for backend use. It's a great 
improvement. For those who want to quickly test the backend capabilities, go ahead and check out our 
gateways updated and get ready with the SDK I'm sorry, with the Lava SDK docs get to testing. Of 
course, this is a call to action for anyone who wants to try it out on the back end and also anyone who can 
help with updating those. Please, please go ahead and check out SDK public alpha. 2s You. Also, we 
have a lot of major changes and improvements which are coming soon to our docs. We are always 
looking for contributors who are interested in charting the unexplored waters of lava. If you have a 
penchant for technical writing or you just have general interest in assisting us grow our body of technical 
knowledge surrounding lava, we would love to talk with you further about our areas of need. There are 
plenty of areas of need, lots of ways that you can contribute. And this is an open source community, so 
we definitely welcome contributions. I'm sorry, did someone speak? 3s Also, we have our provider 
incubation program. We have a number of providers who are already onboarded, but we could use a 
whole army more. If you have any experience being a validator node runner, you work a systems admin 
or you got some DevOps stuff under your belt, consider becoming a lava provider and serving RPC from 
our network. We're still in testnet. There is still a process to become a provider, but it's surely a unique 
experience that will empower you to get more familiar with Web Three. 1s Little reach out to us about 
further details on that. 3s With that, we move to our community wide updates. We want to give a few 
relevant details about what's happening in our ecosystem. The first being that there's a new release out 
now. Version zero point 16.0 has come in with a lot of improvements. So be sure to update your lava d 
binary and whatever else you're using. 1s It will be very helpful for you to definitely fetch those updates 
and take a look because a lot of things have been fixed, a lot of interfaces are being improved. There's 
constant improvements. You can take a look on our GitHub releases page to see more in depth what's 
going on. Additionally, Lavad and lava protocol. The binary is now splitting from lava d to lava d and 
lava protocol. You will definitely want to check this out. Take a look. When you make build your lava d, 
you'll notice that a lava protocol spontaneously appears in the build folder. It's really, really cool. Lava 
Protocol will inherit some of the functions of Lavad, which will gradually be phased over to Lava 
U1
Protocol. So we are splitting the binaries. Do check it out. This is covered in depth in our engineering call 
as well. And then we've added additional front end support for apps on the SDK gateway. This is 
awesome. Big major milestone. Check out the updated gateway with badges. It's like none. Nothing. 
You've seen gateway Lavanet XYZ is where you can go. See this? You can quickly create a project with 
an obscured private key. It's much faster than our previous flow. We're getting good feedback on this. We 
really appreciate those who experiment with and try this feature. There is some front end support for apps 
on our SDK and gateway. It's not foolproof yet. It's still in testnet. SDK is still in alpha. But it is an 
awesome mental feature that is now you no longer have to expose your private key with the use of 
badges. 2s Additionally, if you haven't heard in our recent engineering call, we're going to be forking to a 
new test net in. The next couple of weeks. This means our Validators especially, will need to stake on the 
new chain and pay attention to the announcements as they come. There will be new documentation which 
will assist in the transition, but what you all should know is that this test net fork will empower 
Validators who are already big on our chain, supporting us to move forward on the new chain as soon as 
this test network is complete. 2s Additionally, for those who weren't able to hear it, engineering call 
number nine covered some major changes, including more details on the test network, the binary 
splitting, the badges being implemented, and these updates to our protocols that have all been echoed 
here. It was a great and smooth call hosted on our Twitter spaces, so we're really looking forward to 1s
talking further with those people who get a chance to look at the engineering call if you have any 
questions. 5s All right, 2s our next community presentation, I think, before we get into that, Galladrin 
asked when. The fork planned. It is some time away. I don't have exact dates. There will be more major 
announcements made in terms of changes to our documentation and support for how to make the 
transition coming soon. 5s Next, we have a community presentation by none other than Ruslan Glasniev. 
This is one of our developer champions. We're super excited to have Ruslan as part of our community. 
He's always making big advancements for us and developing new technology within the Lava ecosystem. 
So today we want to spotlight his project. It's a Lava SDK cosmjs integration. It is called the Cosmo Lava 
client. And without saying too much more about it, it allows you to use Lava SDK. I'm sorry. It allows 
you to use cosmjs with Lava SDK together pretty seamlessly. There's a project link here on this page. 
You can check out the GitHub. I will also allow Ruslan to take the stage, share his screen, and give a 
short demo to us. Share some of the magic Rislan, are you present? Yes, thank you. I will start my screen 
share. 3s All right. 3s Do you hear my screen? Do you see? It is blurry for me at the moment. Pixelated. 
Okay, maybe it takes some time. 2s Maybe you can change the stream quality. Oh, it just cleared up. All 
right, I can see it now. Okay. No, it just went blurry again. I'm sorry. Okay, maybe it's because I'm 2s and 
now you can see. 5s Gammy. Yes. I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you. 1s Do you see? Well, right now. 2s Yes. 
We can see the discord window. Is there something else you're intending for us to see? 4s Let me no, you 
have to see another window you can see. 1s No, we just see the discord window. You should be able to 
change the wind. Yeah. There you go. Okay. Entire screen 2s now. Now we can see. 1s All right. So, as 
said, I am a part of Lava Champion developer program. And I created small integration with Cosmjs 
Library, which is super popular library if you want to build something on top of 2s Cosmos SDK but in 
JavaScript. And today I will show small demo how you can use Cosmolava client to send some tokens, 
some small example. 2s So okay. And 2s I will go to my desktop and 1s open some prepared 1s
directory. 4s Actually empty directory and here only with me where describe it what? Actually we need 
and we need environment file with Mnemonic with some funds of lava because it will be needed to create 
offline signer to send some tokens. And also of course we need lava private key to use 1s lava protocol in 
our example. 2s Also, I will 3s mind zooming in the text a little bit. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt. 
15s We will need N dependency to load environment variables. Then we need custom JS Targate it's 
stargate from cosmjs library to interact with Cosmos SDK. Also we need proto signing to create offline 
sign tendermint RPC to create lava tendermint RPC. And my small integration cosmolava client to make 
all things work together. So let's unit project 4s NPM init. And here is some 2s one liner to install all 
dependency in one line. 2s Which I mentioned before. 3s Yeah, the rata met. 6s Okay, 7s wait. 3s When 
all dependency will be installed 2s if seven. 1s All right, 1s so we need some index JS file where we will 
2s create our small I think small script to send some tokens to another wallet. 2s First of all, we need 1s
enable our N 3s to get all our environment variables. 6s It will allow us to get all 1s variables in our 
application. 1s Of course, we need 7s Osmolawa client where we get functions, which is factory 
functions called create cosmo flower http client 2s also we need 8s proto signing 1s to create offline 
signer 2s direct it 8s and we need tendermint clients. 18s Of course. Stargate client to interact with Lava 
SDK. 3s Okay. 2s All dependency imported. And now we need all things done together. I will create 2s a 
function 3s where we will 2s do everything. 4s Okay, for the first one, we need to initialize our 
cosmolava client from my integration. 1s If you're familiar with 1s Lava is decay. 5s It will get. 2s The 
same params as lava SDK so in the Lava SDK we need private key which we will get from our N file. 
Here I have environment example so it's called lava prefk also we need chain ID. 1s Now we will be 
work with lava chain 2s and give allocation is one. So the parameters are same as in 1s lava SDK because 
cosmolava client actually use lava SDK under the hood. Right now we need to create sign 3s offline 
signer to sign our transaction to broadcast it to Lava. 2s It. 2s I will 1s get my 4s raise 3s and 2s prefix. 3s
Prefix is lower, 3s right? Fiber. Um 1s so 3s now we need to create target clients. 2s This target client 
will get 5s now we need tendermint client. 17s So this set is tender bit client which will be used in 
stargate client. 1s And we will create it with our cosmolog client. This tendermint client will use actually 
Lava protocol. And after we initialize it, we can pass it to our Stargate client and interactive Cosmos 
chain. 2s All right, let's do this client. I'm signing Stargate client and sign in Stargate client needs. So we 
need it create with signer. 3s Yes. So compile it will 5s we create it with signer. Our signer is here. 1s
This signer will be used to sign our transaction. 3s And we need to pass our tendermint client, which is 
initialized with cosmolava client, which will be used to interact with network of the Lava. And with this 
client with this Stargate client, we can broadcast our transactions to the network. 2s All right, so let's do 
that. 2s We can 2s call our client and 2s Call 3s there is a method. Send tokens and send tokens he takes 
it few params. First params it is a sender and second params it is receiver. 4s For now we need to get 2s
our account. 1s We need a 1s wallet address from 2s Mnemonic. We we created signer so we can do it to 
call 2s account 3s get accounts 2s also sync. 2s Let's console log it. 3s I will hope it will be work. 1s All 
right, we need some simulator. 4s All right, 1s we have 1s our sender address and I have a mistake 
because prefix 5s yes, we get address 1s so we can make send. Tokens sender it is that address which we 
get from signer with that simple comment. And we need 1s receiver. So we need someone who will get 
coins. 2s I will go to the Power Explorer just for test. 1s And I know that now is Cross Nest validators 2s
in our call. So I will get Cross Nest validator and simply take his account to transfer some funds to his 
account. All Right. And here we need to specify which amount of tokens we would like to send to this 
address 1s for the test. We will specify. 1s I think I need 3s to prompt it here. Amount. 2s Um, 2s we 
will. Just One. 2s And we need to specify the norm DeNoma. I Know. 2s Ah we will pass as the third 
params amount 2s and 1s also we need 1s some 1s gas params to specify I will specify some static 2s
parameters 1s and amount. For instance 5000 it will be our transactions p, 1s Ulawa and 3s let's make 5s
this one. 3s All right, 2s maybe object here. 1s Gas paramps 2s and I think everything done. So we will 
prompt the sender receiver. We specify amount we would like to send one. Ulava and we specify god's 
promise. 2s It. And now we can actually execute our transactions. 3s We just get result 2s from this 
function and simply console. Log it 1s to console. 2s I will comment it and I will run it. 2s Okay. It will 
take some time because 3s in Lava networks one block created each 1 minute. Okay 3s we got it. So we 
have transaction hash our transactions which we send and we can check it. 2s Let's bust our transactions 
hash here and we have message that from address. That's our address 1s here. 3s Yes, that's correct. And 
two address 2s nine V. Yes. And we send 3s one U lava. That's correct. So 1s this is small demonstration 
how you can use Cosmolava client to make all this piece of software from Cosmjs work together. And as 
you can see, we don't use any RPC URL, so we just use Cosmolava client and broadcast our transaction 
to network. 3s Also, 2s you can check different examples. Unfortunately, now it's only two examples, so 
it's token transfer, which we implemented right now, and also LPC Query. So if you're familiar with. 2s
Cosmjs and Lava SDK, you can participate in some contribution 1s and cetera. Also, if you have any 
questions, you can ask me or create an issue. 3s So I think 1s that's all my demo. It demonstrates how we 
can send some tokens with Cosmjs and Cosmolava and Lava protocol. Bravo. Yo. That was nice. That 
was nice. Great demonstration. Excellent integration. We really appreciate it. Just want to give another 
shout out to Ruslan for doing know he was not tasked with doing this. He took it upon himself because 
he wanted to see the integration. I think that's one of the 1s best things we can see in our community is 
when people take the initiative to build the stuff that they want to see. So shout out to you, Ruslan. Thank 
you so much for demonstrating this on our community call. I know we're short on time, so if you all have 
any questions or any follow up for him, please don't hesitate to reach out to him. He's pretty available on 
our discord. Also, reach out to us. We can potentially. Uh, field some of those questions, too. So, Ruslan, 
you're still screen sharing? 2s Okay. 2s All right. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. 2s Thank 
you. So, everyone who is still present, if you can return to my screen, I just want to conclude this call by 
saying thank you all for attending. Our next community call is to be determined. We will see you all next 
month. Our next engineering call also date to follow. We'll have an announcement soon. The closing 
quote that I want to leave you all with is that 1s those who end up accomplishing great things, pay 
attention to little ones. This is a proverb from the country of Mali. With that, I say thank you very much 
for everyone who has attended. This has been a wonderful community call. We're so grateful to have you 
as a part of the Lava ecosystem. We look forward to your participation in future endeavors and want to 
say thanks again. This is Kagemni Karimo, Lava Devrel engineer, signing out. Take care, everybody
