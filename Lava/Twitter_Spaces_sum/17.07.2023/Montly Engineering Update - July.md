`Summary`

# Monthly Engineering Update - July

### Introduction and Casual Conversation
Greetings who joined the call.

### Transition to Twitter Spaces
The team has moved from posting their engineering updates on Discord to Twitter Spaces. In order to become a speaker, you need to connect from your phone, as Twitter Spaces has its own peculiarities.

### Lava Development Process
These engineering calls provide a sneak peek into the development process for Lava, an open standard for Blockchain RPC and APIs. The team is encouraged the community to ask questions, provide feedback, and contribute. The call was attended by key team members including Gil Binder (CTO), Omer Mishael (Chief Architect Officer), and Jacob Avidar (Senior VP Engineering).

### Key Updates
- **Badges**    
Badges, an unique significant innovation in Lava. They allow users to use the full decentralized network in the front end. Badges are likened to a WeWork pass, granting access to the building. In the context of Lava, badges allow front-end users to access all providers on Lava. This solution was developed to address the challenge of allowing access to decentralized networks via the front end, which many other decentralized networks struggled with. Badges are now live and can be used in front-end applications.
- **Upcoming Fork**    
The fork upcoming in the testnet. The fork was triggered by several features, including changes in the specs format, addition of TLS support, and issues with timestamps. The fork will bring several benefits, such as more secure communication, optional APIs, and faster and easier onboarding for the new chain. The team expects future forks to occur, but not very often.
- **Split in Binaries**    
The team announced a split in their binaries. This split will allow for faster deployment of patches that affect the protocol but not the consensus. This separation of the deploy process for providers and consumers will enable faster delivery and functionality improvements that don't affect the entire ecosystem. The team plans to have a mechanism for suggesting the latest protocol version, which will be handled on-chain.

### Conclusion
The team concluded the call by acknowledging the importance of these updates for the community. They expressed their excitement about the upcoming fork and the split in binaries, which they believe will bring significant improvements to the platform. They also emphasized the importance of community participation in these changes and encouraged everyone to stay updated and involved.
