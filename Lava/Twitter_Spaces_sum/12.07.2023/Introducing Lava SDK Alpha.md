# Introducing Lava SDK Alpha


### Introduction and Welcoming
The session started with a casual introduction and some light-hearted banter among the participants. The main purpose of the session was to announce the launch of the Lava SDK in its alpha stage.

### Introduction of Lava SDK
Kagemni Karimu, Lava's Devrel, introduced the Lava SDK, a TypeScript/JavaScript implementation of the Lava protocol that enables direct peer-to-peer communications between developers and RPC providers. The SDK is designed to provide a more reliable, private, and accurate experience for users by connecting them with multiple providers instead of just one. It also incentivizes RPC providers to provide the best possible service and disincentivizes bad service and malicious activity.

### Roundtable Introduction
Gil, the CTO and co-founder of Lava, and Omer, Lava's Chief Architect Officer, were introduced. They expressed their excitement about sharing their hard work and the launch of the SDK Alpha.

### Lava's Basics
Lava allows for decentralized public APIs and RPC. RPC is the standard communication protocol used to interact with blockchain nodes and is used thousands of times whenever any web3 app or service is used. Most apps today rely on a single provider or public RPC, which is unreliable, lacks privacy, and is unverifiable. Lava solves this problem by connecting consumers, developers, apps, services with multiple providers instead of one.

### Lava SDK's Unique Features
Gil explained that what makes Lava unique is that it allows node runners and contributors to build different RPCs for different chains and different APIs for different chains, offer them on Lava, and then have consumers buy a subscription on chain and get peer-to-peer access to all of these providers. This allows for multi-chain, multi-API support at scale, and ensures that the data is accurate.

### Explanation of Lava SDK's Features
Omer explained that the Lava SDK is a library that can be integrated from a backend or frontend using TypeScript or JavaScript. It handles the communication so developers don't have to change anything in their DApp to adapt to a fully decentralized and authenticated access. The SDK also provides data reliability by comparing answers to identify fraud and quality of service between providers.

### Badges System
The Lava SDK introduces a system called "badges". This system allows the user of a DApp to create their own key, get a badge from the DApp, attach the badge to the key, and then communicate with the nodes. This system is designed to be completely decentralized.

### Integration with Other Libraries
The Lava SDK is designed to work with existing frameworks such as Ether.js, CosmJS, Wagmi, and WalletConnect. This makes it easy to use and helps with the adoption of the library.

### Alpha Testing and Future Improvements
The Lava SDK is currently in its alpha testing phase. The team is looking for developers to contribute and help build the SDK. Future improvements include an optimizer feature that allows the SDK to track the quality of service and the latest block of each of its providers and pick the right provider based on the information that is queried.

### Conclusion
The Lava team thanked everyone for their contributions and encouraged developers to join them in pushing the message of Lava to everyone. Lava encouraged developers to try out the SDK and provide feedback.
