# EmpowerChain Community Call



### Introduction
The session begins with a warm welcome to all attendees and an outline of the agenda. The topics to be discussed include Empower and Empower Chain, updates on testnets, the roadmap, and various announcements.

### About Empower
The project was initiated five and a half years ago with the aim of incentivizing individuals to clean up plastic waste, drawing inspiration from the bottle deposit system in Norway. After conducting initial tests in 16 countries, it was recognized that incentives yielded positive results. However, there was a need for enhanced technical infrastructure to effectively manage the plastic waste. It was also observed that the Ethereum-based technology employed at the time was insufficiently scalable for the project's requirements. Consequently, a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform was developed, which is presently operational in 45 countries.

### Empower Chain
Empower is now prepared to decentralize many of its solutions and incorporate the lessons learned into a more comprehensive web3 concept. It is believed that web3 has the potential to scale up and bring together all the pieces necessary for a circular economy.

### Plastic Credits
Among the tools being introduced is the concept of plastic credits, which serve as incentives for collection organizations to accept and manage materials and waste. Additionally, a deposit application and incentive schemes are being implemented to encourage individuals to participate in cleaning up plastic waste.

### Testnet Update
An update is provided on the testnet, expressing satisfaction with the level of engagement and participation from the community. It is confirmed that the project remains on track for the mainnet launch scheduled for the following week.

### Announcements
Teasers are shared regarding forthcoming announcements, including the provision of a password for participants engaging in Zealy tasks on the incentivized testnet.

### StreamSwap
Following the launch, there will be a StreamSwap event, during which a representative from StreamSwap will elucidate its purpose and functionality.

### Leap Wallet
It is announced that Empower Chain will integrate with Leap Wallet, enabling users to directly view their tokens within Leap and engage in activities such as staking through the Leap dashboards.

### Environmental Solutions
Blockchain technology is believed to have the potential to produce intelligent solutions to environmental problems, and Empower is seen as an important part of that.
